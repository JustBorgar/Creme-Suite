The smooth blend of clean, reliable, and scalable platformer magic.

## Description ##

Créme Engine is the open-source 3D platformer engine we handcrafted to power SNM, AH2, EH:ME and all our future platformer projects going forward.

CE is the culmination of all the experience we've gained through the years, and was designed to be the final, dependable, and scalable solution for all our—and your—platformer needs.

> [!NOTE]
> Créme Engine is on it's pre-release stage, it's current state is not indicative of what's intended for the final product.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this stage of development your feedback is invaluable to the development of the resource, so if you have any issues please share them with us.

## Features ##

* Clean, scalable, and strictly typed modular codebase.
* Compact and highly customizable modern EH2018 inspired moveset.
* Reliable, easy-to-use collectibles system managed by a ProfileService database.
* Modular & highly versatile power-ups system inspired by the good old classics.
* Playlist based music zone system.
* Several built-in platformer mechanics, utilities and game components such as a Ragdoll system and a FE2-like swimming system.

And we're just getting started, we're hoping that with your support we can bring you LOTS of additional features in the near future.
